Hi there! Welcome to my blog, a cozy corner of the internet where I share my thoughts on various topics. Currently, I work on HPC, artificial intelligence, and some random things, and I really do not have much time to work on this introduction. I'll try to keep this blog updated and provide more functionalities on the website when I'm free ~~(who knows when, lol)~~.

Topics to be discussed:

☐ Write about OpenMp\
☐ Write about async in cpp\
☐ Write about Megatron-LM
